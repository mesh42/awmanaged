Aw Managed SDK Technology preview provides a Managed .NET SDK layer for the Active Worlds SDK.

This library provides an application framework for the Active Worlds Virtual Reality environment and is written in C# .NET. This is a work in progress, not everything is implemented yet. Currently there's a server console, which can load bot as plugins from a command line prompt. Several services are included in the main bot engine which spawns these plugins as workers. Services such as universal storage db (object oriented), scheduling services, interpreter services are part of the SDK.

You should be able to write simple VR applications on top of this library. Keep in mind though that namespaces, object names their properties, (templated) delgates and interfaces are subject to change in their implementation and naming conventions. The target platform is .NET version 3.5, no tests are currently done in .NET Mono. Because of limitations in the native aw Sdk issued by Active Worlds, the target applications can only support 32 bits executables. The Visual Studio project file is currently targeted to Visual Studio 2010 only (versions prior to 0.5.13 are targeted to Visual Studio 2008 .NET 3.5). There is no solution project for Visual Studio Express users.
