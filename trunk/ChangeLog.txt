* Adding some query example on action strings in the Bot Engin Example.
* Introducing e.SceneNodes als event argument.
* Splitting up Events into templated, local and remote event args.
* Reintroducing non templated event types into botengine for keeping syntax unified between remotingbots and localbots.
