    /// A corona is a transparent image that is stamped on to the 3D scene on top of an object whenever that object is visible to the user. Although similar in some ways to sprites, they differ in that their size does not vary with distance from the camera, and the entire corona is either visible or not visible depending on whether the corona's source object is currently visible (i.e. not obscured by any other object.) The primary purpose of coronas is for creating "halo" effects around local light sources.

While technically any texture can be used as a corona, obviously for a good effect the texture should be one that has been specifically designed to be a corona. If the object also has a light on it, the corona will automatically be colored the same as the light, if it is a non-white light. Thus, a single corona texture can be used for multiple light sources even if they are different colors.
